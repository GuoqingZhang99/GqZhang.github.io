About me
=====
I am current a Phd Student in Operation Research in North Carolina State University. And I grqduated from Financial Mathematics in 2021. In 2020, I enrolled 3+X program (accelerate program) and went to Applied Mathematics and then switched to Financial Mathematics. In my future work, I hope I will do some progress in Algorithm of optimization and Numerical PDEs.
