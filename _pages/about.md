About me
=====
I am currently a Ph.D. Student in Operation Research at North Carolina State University. And I graduated in Financial Mathematics in 2021. In 2020, I enrolled 3+X program (accelerated program) went to Applied Mathematics, and then switched to Financial Mathematics. In my future work, I hope I will make some progress in the Algorithm of optimization and Numerical PDEs.
